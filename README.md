# Machine_Learning_Fake_News_Detector_Project:
I have done this project in task wise manner to make it simplified.

1.Understand the problem statement and business case  

2.Import libraries/datasets and perform preliminary data processing

3.Perform Exploratory data analysis

4.Perform data cleaning

5.Visualize datasets

5.Prepare the data by performing tokenization and padding

6.Understand the intuition behind recurrent neural networks

7.Understand the intuition behind LSTMs

8.Train an LSTM Model

9.Assess/evaluate trained model performance
